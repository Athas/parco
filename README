Parco - general parser combinators for Haskell
===

This library provides general parser combinators that can be used with
multiple different underlying parser implementations, for example
Parsec or Attoparsec.

This repository contains several packages that are developed in sync -
the main `parco` package, as well as interfaces to different concrete
parser implementations.  This division is to ensure that `parco`
itself does not depend on parser implementations that the user is not
interested in.
